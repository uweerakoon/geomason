<h2>GeoMASON: NetworkWorld</h2> 
By Mark Coletti and Keith Sullivan
</table>
     The intent of NetworkWorld example is to show how to have an agent move along a network, or graph, of line segments. 
     The simulation first creates a simple network of lines and junctions.  Next an agent is placed inside the network 
     (i.e., on an edge), and the agent then moves along the edge.  When the agent reaches a junction, it chooses a random 
     direction, and continues along the network. 
     
     <p> The procedure demonstrated here can also be used for having an agent travel along a network created from GIS data.  
     See the GeoMASON CampusWorld example for more information.
