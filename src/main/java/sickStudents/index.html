        The SickStudents GeoMASON example shows the spread of influenza through the schools and households of Fairfax County, VA.

        <p>This demo introduces a new agent-based model (ABM) for studying the
spread of influenza through the schools and households of Fairfax County, VA.
It is intended to explore the following questions: <br>
<br> - How does an epidemic outbreak
spread through a school system? 
<br> - What containment approaches might be most
effective at stopping an outbreak?
