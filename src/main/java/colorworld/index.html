<h2>GeoMASON: ColorWorld</h2> 
By Mark Coletti and Keith Sullivan
</table>
  
    This demo shows how to change the portrayal of individual geometries inside GeoMASON.  Our simple example 
    has agents randomly wandering around the Fairfax County, VA, voting districts.  The shade of each district
    is based on the number of agents currently inside the district.
