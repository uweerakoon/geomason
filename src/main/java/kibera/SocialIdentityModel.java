	 * Identity salience is a function of:
	 * (1) Embeddedness of the individual in a social structure (commitment) -- student/employee
	 * (2) The fit of the identity with situational stimuli (the action the agent takes)
	 * (3) Characteristics of the identity such as its accessibility
	 * 
	 * Connectedness increases the salience of the identity, making it more likely that the identity will 
	 * be activated in a given situation; persons occupying densely connected positions and holding 
	 * related roles will have identities associated with those position and roles that are more salient
	 * 
	 * Persons have as many identities as distinct networks of relationships
	 * 
	 * The action determines who the agent interacts with
 	 * Each interaction increases the connectness of the interacting agents
	 * This influences the identities salient to each agent
	 */
	
	//Determine which identity is salient
	//compare salient identity to individual's identity standard via the Comparator (Perceptions are 
	//compared to the identity standard)
	//Output can impact an agents emotions -- self-esteem, self-efficacy, stress

	/*
	 * Salience is the probability of activating an identity in a situation
	 * 
	 * Hierarchy of identities:
	 * Three levels: a superordinate level such as human, an intermediate level such as american,
	 * and a subordinate level such as southerner.
	 * 
	 * A particular identity becomes salient/activated as a function of the interaction between the 
	 * characteristics of the perceiver and the situation
	 * Individual perceives herself as like one set of persons and different from another set of persons 
	 * in a situation
	 * This is the perception of intra-class similarities and inter-class differences
	 * 
	 * Identity salience implies that person are more likely to define situations they enter in ways 
	 * that make a highly salient identity relevant; this process enables them to enact that identity
	 * 
	 * If the identity confirmation process is successful, the salience of the identity will be 
	 * reinforced; if the process is unsuccessful, the salience of the identity is likely to diminish
	 * 
	 * If competing or conflicting identities reflect greatly different commitments and consequently 
	 * differ greatly in salience, the identity based on greater commitments and higher salience will be 
	 * reflected (in situations where alternative identities can be invoked) in the operative identity 
	 * standard and perceived self-meanings
	 */
	
	/*
	 * Identities:
	 * Superordinate: Human -- don't need to model
	 * Intermediate -- Kenyan, Employee, Student
	 * Subordinate -- Ethnicity, Employee of xx company, Student of xx school, Head of household
	 * 
	 * creation of ingroup vs outgroup
	 * happens has salience for ethnic identity becomes more pronounced
	 *  	
	 * 
	 * how connected a resident is with those with similar ethnicity, will increase the salience of 
	 * their ethnic identity -- both within the slum and outside (family in other regions of the country)
	 * but residents who have more commitments -- student/employee -- less likely to see that salience increase
	 * 
	 * residents will seek to meet employee and student identities
	 * if student age, will look to go to school
	 * 
	 * go to school:
	 * primary is free, secondary is not
	 * families will prioritize sending sons over daughters to secondary school (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wendy-cross/a-community-response-to-g_b_914841.html)
	 * 
	 * children of primary and secondary school age will search for a school that has not reached capacity
	 * if household has boy and girl of school age, then boy will search first
