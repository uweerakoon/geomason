        <p>
        In this model we demonstrate how one can use polygons (such as census
        tracks) to create an abstract Schelling model stylized on Washington DC.
        The model reads in a ESRI Polygon shapefile and uses attributes of the
        shapefile to create Red and Blue agents and a number of Unoccupied areas.
        As with the traditional Schelling model, Red and Blue agents want to be
        located in neighborhoods were a certain percentage of their neighbors are
        of the same type. However, instead of using a Moore or Von Neumann which
        is common practice in cell based models, neighborhoods are calculated
        using the neighbors that share a common edge to the agent in question. If
        an agent is dissatisfied with its current neighborhood, it will move to
        a random Unoccupied polygon, regardless of whether or not this new location
        meets its preference.
