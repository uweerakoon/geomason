   This example shows how to insert geometries into a GeomVectorField without using 
   underlying GIS files. The example also shows how to move an agent around in a 
   GeomVectorField, and have the agents query the field for ojbects within a 
   specified distance.  

	<p> As the agent moves about the environment, it will print out the nearby objects as 
	well as its current location.
