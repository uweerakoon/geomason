This <project>/data directory is intended to contain data that the user might
want to change after the release of the program.  For example, one might want
to see how the model behaves when using input from a different climate model.

There is another directory for data (<project>/src/files), and any data placed
in there will end up being put in the .jar file.  Any data that is not likely
to change, and is not too large, can be placed there in order to make the
release process easier.
