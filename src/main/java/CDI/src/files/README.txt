This <project>/src/files directory is intended to contain data that will be
placed in the ".jar" file.  It is only appropriate for data that meets the
following criteria:

1) The program needs to access the data while running
2) The user is not likely to want to try other data as input (for example, the
   results of a different climate model)
3) The data is not too big.  It is difficult to distribute a ".jar" file that
   is too large.
