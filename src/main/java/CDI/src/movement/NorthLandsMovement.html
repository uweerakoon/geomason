<p>This is the Movement component model of the federated MASON Northlands Model.</p> 

<p>ver 7.5, Oct 25, 2016: writing data for line plots to CSV file and bug fix in recording of total rural wealth. </p>
<p>ver 7.4, May 12, 2016: bug fix in infrastructure costs & compiled via NetBeans</p>
<p>ver 7.3, Jan 3, 2016: simple weather file names & compiled in NetBeans</p>
<p>ver 7.2, Nov 2, 2015: bug fixed household wealth affecting GDP of H1-1</p>
<p>ver 7.1, Oct 29, 2015: to run experiment H1-1, diff data printed to csv</p>
<p>ver 7.0, Oct 13, 2015: improve displays, graphs and handling of missing data</p>
<p>ver 6.0, Sept 9, 2015: consolidate displays (removing de-bugging)</p>
<p>ver 5.0, July 9, 2015: gov't agents tax wealth to support infrastructure, 
can experiment with single year's weather repeated for full run, 
& many plots added.
</p>

<p>
ver 4.0, May 12, 2015: can run from any date after 1911 to any date before 2100. 
From 1911 through 2004, the system uses historical data. From 2005 to 2099, the system 
uses the RCP 2.6 (optimistic) projected weather as the default.

This model was designed by: Claudio Cioffi-Revilla and J. Daniel Rogers. 
It has been implemented in code by Jeffrey K. Bassett (Postdoctoral Fellow and
Lead Programmer), Ermo Wei, Peter Fron&#x010D;ek, Brendon Fuhs, and William G. Kennedy.
