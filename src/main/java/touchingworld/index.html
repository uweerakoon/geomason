    This demo shows how to compute geometry that touches other geometry.  A set 
    of arbitrary polygons is displayed.  <em>Unselected</em> polygons are
    colored blue; one is <em>selected</em>, which is indicated by being red.
    With each time step the next selected polygon is chosen from those that are
    touching the currently selected.
